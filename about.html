			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>Hi, this is Fan Suen,  a UX designer working in Shanghai, I got interested in software design since college, learning and engaging in it for years. I’m particularly experienced in business software design and App design. I have tackled difficult design challenges, mentored teams and shipped products with great UX.
			</p>

			<p>I achieve results by recognizing the underlying patterns in a design that can make or break it. I understand what can be dropped, what needs to be retained, and what needs to be developed. Finally, I know how to package design requirements for developers to make great products.</p>

			<p>With basic knowledge of html and css, I’m good at build relationships with engineering teams and push things forward, design guidelines and UI framework that can be used on multiple platforms.
			</p>

			<p>Experienced in storytelling and create user scenario, storyboard and low-fi motion graphic video to communicate with users and stakeholders.
