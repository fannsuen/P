			<h4>Project Intro</h4>
			<p>Every project, even a self-initiated one, has a reason to exist. We want to focus on the problem that you took on. What was the impetus for building a mobile application? What insights led a to the creation of a multi-channel campaign? Why did you choose one logo over another? Tell a story about the client, their needs, and why you aligned best with them.</p>
			<p><strong>Goal for the project: </strong>Give your reader context and write a quick sentence about what this project or product is all about. This will show your experience and interest in specific types of clients or design work. Naming the location will also help if you want to make it clear you work with clients all over, as opposed to just your hometown.</p>
			<p><strong>Clients: </strong>What did the client ask you to do? What was the briefing? What was the main challenge and measure of success? Did you have a certain idea or expectation for the project when you began?</p>
			
			<h4>My role in the team</h4>
			<p>Anything interesting to share about your process for this project? Did you take a unique angle or notice some surprising insight? Do you have some early sketches we can see? Why did you choose that approach? Ask yourself why, and then answer those questions.</p>
			<p>If you take the time to call out what you did, and what others did, not only does it make you feel good for telling the truth, it tells a recruiter that you’re a team player, and willing to let others have the spotlight. No one designs a multifaceted series of executions for a museum on their own. And no one wants to hire a diva.</p>

			<h4>Works and Contributions</h4>
			<p>Remember back in elementary school when you were told to show your work? It’s because of two reasons: 1. You didn’t cheat, and 2. You have a grasp of the “how” when it comes to solving a problem.</p>
			<p>While the outcome is important, we also want to validate the process of how a designer achieves a solution. Was there research? Iterations? What blew up in their face, and what did they learn from that experience? It’s vital to show these steps in the portfolio, as they not only reveal the process of the designer, but show the care & attention to detail that we require on our projects.</p>
			<p>Even when it comes to front end developers, it’s important to show how you arrived at a particular codebase, why you chose certain templates or plugins, why you coded something a certain way. Just like in Tip 1, it’s part of the story.</p>

			<h4>Outcomes</h4>
			<p>This is a difficult tip to write, because there is a place for work that has measurable outcomes and a place for work that is done for the sake of creating something to display a designer’s creativity. Both are important when it comes to telling your story, and surprisingly, both can be measurable.</p>
			<p>I encourage you to dig deep.</p>
			<p>Did your work move someone to tears? Did they thank you enthusiastically? Did your work enable a company to make a profit? Did they succeed because of your efforts?</p>
			<p>The effect a design or project has is very important when we review portfolios. It’s a measure of success, and odds are, you can find it.</p>

			<h4>In conclusion</h4>
			<p>There are many things you can do to show off your work, and my tips are hardly exhaustive. You should show your work to as many people as possible, and get feedback whenever you can. It will make you a stronger designer, and a better communicator.</p>
